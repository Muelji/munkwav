            <p>
                MY goal is to alleviate poverty and to sustainably improve the living standards of the poor, unemployed women and marginalized people.
                The Munkwav Self Help Trust and Foundation is a personal initiative of Mrs Awuese A. Atedze, in her community service initiative and the need to give back to the local community, where she found herself at the instance of matrimony. In the heat of the covid19 pandemic, when the economic situation was very tough especially for the Rural women whose living is essentially Hand- to mouth, the foundation was born. It came from my long-standing desire to reach out to the people whose living is subsistent in nature and especially women who are obviously struggling with survival. As a child, “I observed my parent’s love for reaching out with help to friends and the extended family at any time it was required of them, and how they will make us to give out, even the clothes on our back if the need arose. This desire to somehow empower them and open up the space for those of them who can thrive in small business ventures came to the fore, in my idle time during the pandemic. The Foundation has a Board of Trustees made up of 7 people, with like minds and a flare for community service.
